# Dataset Visualization

## Overview
This repository contains code for visualizing the distribution of variables in a dataset. The dataset includes various demographic and economic indicators for different countries.

## Dataset Description
The dataset includes the following columns:

- Country Name: Name of the country
- Country Code: ISO country code
- Region: Geographic region of the country
- IncomeGroup: Income group classification
- Year: Year of observation
- Birth rate, crude (per 1,000 people): Number of births per 1,000 people
- Death rate, crude (per 1,000 people): Number of deaths per 1,000 people
- Electric power consumption (kWh per capita): Electricity consumption per capita in kWh
- GDP (USD): Gross Domestic Product in USD
- GDP per capita (USD): GDP per capita in USD
- Individuals using the Internet (% of population): Percentage of population using the Internet
- Infant mortality rate (per 1,000 live births): Number of infant deaths per 1,000 live births
- Life expectancy at birth (years): Life expectancy at birth in years
- Population density (people per sq. km of land area): Population density in people per square kilometer of land area
- Unemployment (% of total labor force) (modeled ILO estimate): Unemployment rate as a percentage of the total labor force

## Code Description
The code included in this repository allows you to visualize the distribution of variables in the dataset using various types of plots:
- Histogram: Visualizes the distribution of a continuous variable.
- Bar Chart: Visualizes the distribution of a categorical variable.
- Pie Chart: Alternative visualization for the distribution of a categorical variable.
- Scatter Plot: Visualizes the relationship between two continuous variables.

## Instructions
1. Ensure that you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required Python libraries by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Replace `'your_dataset.csv'` with the file path of your dataset in the code.
4. Run the code to generate visualizations of the dataset variables.
